# Cog Health Calculator
A calculator for cog health for Disney's Toontown Online as well as its private servers. 

For normal cog levels (1-12), this application will run the expression (level+1)(level+2) to find the amount of health the specified cog level has. There is also a checkbox to specify if the given cog is a V2.0, which multiplies the cog's health by two, accounting for both the normal cog and skelecog form.

This program is largely an experiment for me, it's the first program I made on my own! Thank you for checking it out :)
